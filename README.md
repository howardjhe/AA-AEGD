# AA-AEGD
This repository is the implementation of AA-AEGD, see the paper from https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08578v1. The codes show the performance of AA-AEGD on the quadratic and rosenbrock functions, and the problems of machine learning (ML). As for the cases of quadratic function and ML, we adapted the codes from https://github.com/vienmai/AA-Prox. More detail about AEGD https://github.com/txping/AEGD.
